<img src="/images/eelke-spaak.png" class="bio-profile-pic" alt="Eelke Spaak profile photo">Eelke Spaak (1985, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) is principal investigator of the Brain & Experience Lab. After his undergraduate studies in artificial intelligence (BSc) and philosophy (BA), he completed two research master's degrees in cognitive neuroscience (MSc, Radboud University) and philosophy (MSc, University of Edinburgh, funded by Huygens Talent Programme Grant). By then finally realizing what he wanted to do, he completed his PhD under the supervision of Prof. Ole Jensen at the Donders Institute, studying the role of alpha and gamma oscillations in structuring visual experience and local cortical processing.

After finishing his PhD in 2015, he moved to the University of Oxford to pursue a postdoc with Prof. Mark Stokes. His postdoctoral research concerned the relative contributions of static and dynamic neural codes to the maintenance of working memory. The work he did in Oxford also laid the foundation for research lines still ongoing in the lab; namely, those investigating the role of rapid connectivity modulations in working memory. For this work, Eelke was awarded the Postdoctoral Fellow Award by the Cognitive Neuroscience Society.

In 2018, Eelke was awarded an NWO Veni grant to study the often paradoxical relationship between consciousness and predictive processing. For this work, he returned to the Donders Institute, working with Prof. Floris de Lange from 2018 to 2021. Apart from elucidating how contextual information can not only help, but also hinder, our conscious awareness, this work laid the foundation for another still-ongoing research line: leveraging computational (AI) models of _stimuli_ to enable meaningful inferences about how the brain processes naturalistic stimuli (such as music, or natural visual scenes).

In 2022, Eelke was appointed assistant professor at the Donders Institute and started his own research group. Current research focuses on information gathering during real-world visual gaze behaviour, its neural correlates, and the relationship to reward (NWO Starting Grant, 2023); the aforementioned role of (synaptic) connectivity patterns in working memory (NWO Science Open Competition M Grant, 2025); as well as methodological innovations such as Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT).

Eelke contributes to university teaching at various levels and on various topics, including the scientific method, attention and prediction, and advanced electrophysiological analyses. In 2024, Eelke was appointed director of the research MSc programme in cognitive neuroscience (in parallel to his faculty and principal investigator position).
