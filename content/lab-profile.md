At each moment, our conscious, subjective experience of the world is determined not just by information coming from that world, such as the light that strikes our eyes or the air that enters our ears. Instead, our conscious experience is determined to a large extent by how our brains process this information. In turn, our experience of the world influences the structure of our brains. The Brain & Experience (B&E, or BAE, if you're Gen Z) Lab is concerned with how our brains (and bodies) shape our subjective experience, and vice versa.

If the above sounds rather ambitious for a single research group: it is. To make this overarching goal more concrete, we focus on – among others – the following interrelated research questions:

- What can we learn by viewing the brain as a Bayesian, predictive, inference machine?
- What is the role of neural oscillations; how do these relate to cortical (micro)circuitry, and how do they interact with incoming sensory information?
- How does the brain decide when to gather more (sensory) information, and when to act instead; and what is the role of neural reward centers in this decision?
- What is the neural code for working memory; how are incoming stimuli briefly stored, and how do they interact with behavioural goals and future input?

We tackle the above through a combination of behavioural experiments, electro-/magneto-encephalography (EEG/MEG), intracranial electrophysiology, theoretical reflection, computational modelling, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-inspired analyses of stimuli and neural data. Our work includes developing novel analysis and experimental methods, such as Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT).

The B&E Lab is passionate about and committed to Open Science and Open Source.
